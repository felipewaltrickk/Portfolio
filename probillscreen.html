						<b>Projeto</b> <br><br>
						An important skill for any freelance designer is to know how to scope out a project and then the
						ability to keep within the scope. I kicked off this collaboration by flushing out what their
						specific needs were and estimating my time to find a solution. We regrouped over a slack call
						and
						once everyone was aligned began the fun stuff: design exploration.

			<h5>Cenário atual</h5>
			<p>
				<br>
				They needed a concept for what direction to take the itineraries. They were finding customers want
				to connect the stunning photos, with a specific photo spot, along with the key activity of the day.
				<br>
				For the first direction, I intentionally limited the number of changes to the original design
				template. This would allow for a quick and easy solution to the problem without much dev work. I
				reduced the length of the page by collapsing the itineraries into expandable sections, added “Photo
				spots from Day 1” to give a small gallery for what users can expect, and added a section on what
				they can expect to learn that day.
				<br>
				For the second direction, I used a concept where I tried to make each day become an immersive
				experience that users can click through and take on one day at a time. It maintains the same
				side-scrolling ux that the design currently uses, but allows each of the “polaroid-esque” cards to
				open up and share all the details.
				<br>
				For the third direction, I added full-width images to the itinerary. I simplified the itinerary to
				focus on the main events and allowed room for the image to tell it’s own story.<br>
